    <p>Posted on Sun 07 February 2016 in <a href="/category/coding.html">Coding</a></p>

    <p>I've always wondered when it will be practical to write code in the cloud (and not locally).
Most of the apps I use have already moved to the cloud: email, calendar, docs, music. Writing code is one of the last blockers to a true thin client approach for me (the other notable one being photo management).</p>
<p>Recently I've been using <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud9</a> for writing code in the cloud, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it: it just works for me. It's basically <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> plus an IDE: you get a Docker container running Ubuntu that you can access over a web IDE. Docker is a pretty standard thing, so there's not much to say there. The good news is that there's also not much to say about the IDE: <strong>it just works</strong>.</p>
<p>You can theme it, I have it set up to look and feel like Sublime. It has a nice treeview on the left, you can do simple file management there. Shortcuts like copy/paste, find, etc. work as expected, as does full-text search. It's quite impressive, I've been using it for about 2 months and I haven't run into a single instance where the webapp/javascripts feeling leaks through. Part of the IDE is the ability to open terminal consoles. Like the editing, the terminal also just works, including copy/paste, shortcuts, and so on. The one use-case I found where the IDE doesn't work is over mobile: trying to use it over a touch interface is horrible. They're working on it and this will get better over time.</p>
<p>Some screenshots:</p>

</ul>
<p>The one problem I kept hitting is that I'm used to Cmd-Tab'ing to get to Sublime, but if it's running in Chrome it's a tab window. I couldn't get used to that. So I used <a href="https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/blog/2010/08/149/Create+application+shortcuts+in+Google+Chrome+on+a+Mac">this shell script</a> to create a dedicated Cloud9 Chromium app.</p>
<p>The container is accessible from the outside, so if you launch a webserver on localhost:8080, you can open it from your browser at https://<project>-<username>.c9users.io. At first I thought this is public so anybody can see it, but they check whether you're logged into c9, so actually only you can see it---nice!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://c9.io/pricing/webide">business model</a> is freemium. In the free tier can run 1 private docker container (with 1G space); you can launch more, but they will be public, meaning anybody can see your files. For $20/month you get unlimited private containers, and 10G disks (see <a href="https://docs.c9.io/docs/reaching-resource-limits">reaching resource limits</a>). I've been using the free tier, right now I'm at 50% disk usage. Most of it is stuff I install to get something working (<code>apt-get</code>, <code>pip install</code>, etc).</p>
<p>This also enables a nice "separation of concerns": you can work on your personal projects on a computer (eg. work computer) without storing any files on it.</p>
